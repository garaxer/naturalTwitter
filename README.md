Twitter

For displaying tweets have another route like /tweets which gets the current tweets from the bucket like the chat app instead of passing them to the client
 instead of posting with the form use client side js to retrieve the post results which can just be JSOn like in the chat app example.

 npm install wordnet-db
  npm install compromise
maybe find two users and see which one uses more verbs or something.
